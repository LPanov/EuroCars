**Key Features**
 - Product Catalog Management: Allows users to browse a comprehensive list of auto parts.
 - Robust Filtering: Implemented advanced server-side logic to filter products by two critical criteria:
 - Car Model (e.g., Audi A3, Ford F-150) and Part category

  spring.datasource.username=[your_username]
  spring.datasource.password=[your_password] _

Run the Application:

    mvn spring-boot:run _
    
Access the Application: 
    Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/ (or the port specified in your configuration)

## 🛠️ Database Initialization and Setup

> **IMPORTANT:** This sequence must be followed for the *initial* setup to ensure the application starts with required reference data.

1.  **Schema Generation:**
    * Start the `cart-svc` and the main application for the first time to automatically generate all required database tables.
    * User with email 'admin@admin.com' and password 'Admin123' will be generated automatically
    * Stop the application after the tables are created.

2.  **Reference Data Population:**
    * Locate the file `table_creations.sql` in the main folder of the project.
    * Run the insert statements inside this file. This process populates the core reference tables: `brands`, `models`, `engines`, `categories`, and `manufacturers`.

3.  **Application Data Seeding:**
    * Start the application again. The `PartInit` component will run, generating a sample `Part` record for testing.
